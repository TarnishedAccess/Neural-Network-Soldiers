#====MAIN====
add theta rotation
add FOV
add directional line
add vision lines
check vision line collision						
	obstacle collision detection
	enemy collision detection
	friendly collision detection
give characters team specific sprites					
calculate collision distance instead of 0s and 1s		
make a shooting function						
make neural network 								
implement neural network to game (let neural network control actions)
proper collision/tiling for obstacles					
alternate sprites for obstacles/rocks 					<= YOU ARE HERE
optimize model 								

#===OPTIONAL===
interface for terrain gen
more options for terrain gen
UI/info on soldiers during runtime
darken walls
