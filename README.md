# Neural Network Soldiers
 
-Run one of the generation algorithms to generate a map  
-Run game  
  
## OPTIONAL:
-More/Better generation algorithms 
-???  

## TODO:
-add rotation  
-add FOV  
-add directional line  
-add raycasting lines  
-check raycasting collision  			
	-obstacle collision detection  
	-enemy collision detection  
	-friendly collision detection  
-give characters team specific sprites  
-calculate collision distance instead of 0s and 1s  
-make shooting function  
-make neural network  
-implement neural network to game (let neural network control actions)  
-optimize model 	                                                    <= YOU ARE HERE  
-train model
